### Tech stack:

- [Passport.js](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)
- [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres)
- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react)

### What I have done in this project:

#### Server-side
- Login by username & password
- Login by Google account using OAuth2 *(in development)*

#### Client-side
- Use service worker to have offline access *(v2)*
- Use cache by setting HTTP cache header & the service worker
- Form validation by [`formik`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) & [`yup`](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- User roles (maybe different permissions between users of the same role as well): `admin` (for app's settings & stats), `free`|`premium` user *(v2)*
- Recover password *(impossible without an email-sending service)*

#### Security
- Client hashes password before sending over HTTPS
- Server receives password MD5 hash from client, then encrypt it using [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) with strongly crypto-randomed salt for each account
- XSRF protection using JWT with RSA-512 algorithm *(now it's still)*
- Limit submitting times (block IP/MAC address, use Google's reCAPTCHA) *(in development)*
- Prevent attacks via API requests *(how???)*

#### UX (it's important, isn't it? ðŸ˜Š)
- Key press event listeners (Esc, Enter,...) while opening popups, filling in forms,...
